# Decisions

## M1 foundation

- **Pop-out generation boundary:** generation will run client-side in the
  studio editor first. This keeps the MVP CPU/client-only and avoids requiring
  headless WebGL or native canvas support in the Railway worker. The worker
  remains responsible for deterministic validation, MindAR compilation, and
  static page rendering.
- **Background removal:** use `@imgly/background-removal` behind a small
  adapter. It runs locally and is never a paid or network AI dependency in the
  publish critical path.
- **Optional AI 3D:** `AI3DProvider` is an interface only. It is disabled when
  `AI3D_API_KEY` is absent and is never used by tests.
- **Static delivery:** generated AR pages are uploaded to R2 when configured,
  otherwise Supabase public storage is the fallback. Consumer page requests
  do not call the application API.
